**Hastati** (lit. spearman, but they don't wield spears), the second best troops, form the first line of the formation. They wield large oval shields and pila (sigular: pilum), wear some armors and helmets. Their job is to hit the enemy hard and wear them down.
**Principes** are the best of the troops. They charge after the Hastati to finish the job. They have better equipments than the Hastati.
**Triarii** are the third line of the formation (hence the name). They _do_ have spears. They are the veterans as they are going to save the day if the enemies reached them. They have best equipments. They _might_ be at the back to stop everyone from routing.
**Equites** are light cavalries. They tends to be the rich guys for they have to own and maintain their horse. Roman cavalries are not the best. They usually are used to lure enemy cavalries out of the battle.

No archers, slingers, heavies cavalries.
