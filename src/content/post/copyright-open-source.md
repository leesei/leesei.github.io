Unlike the environment RMS experienced in the 60s, the new generation were exposed to proprietary software more than free software. They embraces use of proprietary software if it is the best fit for the job.
This generational gap lead to the division and the birth of OSI.
OSS, represented by UC Berkeley, is about advancing the state of the art without political overlay.

## Corporate OSS

Open-source-ness is not enough, the enterprises would not adopt a project if a single vendor benefits from the communities' contribution to it.
It has been a trend to set up "foundations" to take up successful project from enterprise:

- Google donating Kubernetes to CNCF
- Joyent donating Node to Node Foundation
- Docker donating libcontainer to OCI
