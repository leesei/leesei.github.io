The First World War (the Great war) breaks a century of tranquility between all the Great Powers since the downfall of Napoleon at Waterloo in 1815.
It started out from the assassination of Austria-Hungary's Archduke, heir to the throne, by the Black Hands in Serbia on 28 June 1914 (The Sarajevo event). Austria-Hungary then declared war to Serbia.
German invaded neutral Belgium in order to attack France, dragging UK into the First World War.
Ottoman Empire then attacked Russian Ports in Black Sea in an agreement with German for potential territorial gains.

Modern warfare, troop sizes outnumbered any war took place before.
A division is equivalent to a nice sized medieval army, any there are tens of divisions.

WWI indirectly lead to the fall of Ottoman Empire and Russian Empire.

## Mines of Messines

British engineers dug secret tunnels towards German trenches near the French town of Messines for 18 months. They formed caves under the German trenches and packed with 500 tonnes of explosives. On 7 June 1917, the Mines of Messines were set off, instantly killing about 10000 German troops.

## Sea battle

The expensive navy army succumbed to inexpensive water mine and submarines (German's U-Boats).
The new class battle cruisers (battleship's firepower + cruiser's speed, sacrificing armor) proved to be a failure in navy battle.
