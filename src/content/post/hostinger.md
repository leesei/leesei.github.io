Each website is hosted on a virtual machine, and resources are distributed more evenly. This makes cloud hosting more scalable and reliable.

Web Hosting: In shared web hosting, resources like CPU, RAM, and storage are shared among multiple users.
Cloud Hosting: Cloud hosting typically offers dedicated resources, and you can easily scale up your resources as needed. This means you have more control over the allocation of resources.
4. Pricing:
Web Hosting: Web hosting plans are generally more affordable because you're sharing resources with others. They are suitable for small to medium websites and those on a budget.
Cloud Hosting: Cloud hosting tends to be more expensive due to its scalability and dedicated resources. It's ideal for businesses and websites with fluctuating or high traffic.

Cloud hosting offers better performance, scalability, and resource control, making it a good choice for businesses, high-traffic websites, or those with fluctuating demands. Your hosting plan should be based on your website's specific needs and your budget.
