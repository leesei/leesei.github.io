## Event Sourcing

[Event Sourcing](https://martinfowler.com/eaaDev/EventSourcing.html)
[Event Store](https://eventstore.org/) The stream database written from the ground up for event sourcing.

Events log is the single source of truth.
Allows changing schema by replaying event history to get latest state.

## MVC/MVVM/MVP

[Which Software Architecture Should You Use: MVC, MVP, or MVVM? - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHhXoCNCI1c)
[ArjanCodes/2022-gui](https://github.com/ArjanCodes/2022-gui)

**MVC**
V has reference to M, C has reference to V and M
**MVP**
V has reference to P, P has reference to V and M
P serves as a facade between V and M
**MVVM**
data binding
V bind to VM's property, VM don't have reference to V

[Why I No Longer Use MVC Frameworks](https://www.infoq.com/articles/no-more-mvc-frameworks/) ‚ùó!important
MVP is not as flexible as MVVM as the Presenter can only exist with a View.

A proper Model is ignorant of the ViewModel, and a proper ViewModel is ignorant of the View. However, often a programmer tailors the data types exposed by the ViewModel to the data types associated with particular user interfaces.
