## Concurrency and Parallelism

[[go-lang#Concurrency]]
[[python-notes#Concurrency]]
[[rust-lang#Async/Future]]

Concurrency:

- composition of independently executing processes
- multiple tasks
- about _dealing_ with lots of things at once, about structure

Parallelism:

- simultaneous execution of computations
- multiple processing units
- about _doing_ lots of things at once, about execution
- Concurrency is a _prerequisite_ (Parallelism implies Concurrency)

Linux's epoll, BSD's kqueue, none of them worked for file IO
Windows IOCP, proactive completion based IO, no extra syscall for polling state, no batch submission
non of them worked great for file IO, use thread pool
Linux io-uring, proactive completion based IO, no extra syscall for polling state, batch submission, kernel space thread pool
porting io-uring to zig in user space
per thread ring buffer use by many
