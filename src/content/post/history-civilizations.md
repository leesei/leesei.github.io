Semitic linguistic group moved to Canaan. Hebrew called other Semitic speaking tribes living there Canaanite, Greeks called them Phoenician. Hebrew controls southern Canaan after the exodus. Philistines, which is connected to the Greeks (maybe refugee during the invasion of sea people), controlled the southernmost coastline of Canaan and conflicted with the Hebrews. Phoenician is then used to refer to the Semitic speaking tribes living in the northern Canaan.
Phoenicia = Lebanon + northern Syria
Phoenician is great at trading and have trade routes and colonies throughout Europe spreading to England
one colony, Carthage in north Africa, fought with Romans in the Punic War during Hannibal's time
Greek and Phoenician are the dominant trading power in the region
trading contact spread Phoenician alphabet to the Greek around 1000B.C.
being a Semitic language, the Phoenician alphabet have lots of consonants but no vowels. Greeks adopted consonants directly and converted the unused letters for vowels

Hebrews adopted Phoenician alphabet around 900B.C., a century before the Greeks. they reduced their oral stories as writing in 800B.C., forming the Old Testament.

Greeks are partitioned around the city states and not as a single nation, 776B.C. Olympic Games
Greeks transformed into democracy in 600B.C.
490B.C., Greece defeated the Persians in War of Marathon
Sparta is in the southern part of Greek and, like Persia, took military training
300 Spartans stop the Persians
Greece city states joining forces against foreign threats

Macedonians in the north of Greek is greatly influenced by Greece culture but did not speak Greece. Under the leadership of Phillips II Macedonia eclipsed power of Athens and Spartan. 338B.C. Macedonia defeat Greece alliance and united Greek into a single political entity.
son of Phillips II, Alexander defeated the Persian Empire once and for all.

Aristotle was born in 384B.C., tutor of King Phillip II's son, Alexander.
when Alexander conquered East Mediterranean, through Mesopotamia to India, he brought the vast and detailed celestial observations by the Babylons to the Hellenistic world. He then built the largest library in Alexandria, Egypt.
Socrates -> Plato -> Aristotle -> Alexander

Macedonian Greece was defeated by the Romans in xxx, but Greece was already the lingua franca in the Mediterranean, especially in the eastern Mediterranean which continues to use Greece under Roman rules in 1-3 century. New Testament was written in Greece which helped it spread.

The History of English Podcast 17 Celtic

they dominated western and northern Europe. the distinction between Germanic and Celtic tribes are sometimes difficult. they were neighboring tribes and influenced each other culturally, some Celtics later merged into Germanic tribe. Romans used Celtic word for human to name the Germanic tribes that arrived in eastern Europe, modern Hungary, the Teutons. Germanic itself is the name of a Celtic tribe living east of the Rhine, which is used by Romans to name all people living to the northeast of Rhine. Celtics are illiterate so most record are them are written by contemporary cultures, the Romans and Greeks, which may not be in good terms with the Celtics. Romans are not too concerned with the distinction between Celtic and Germanic as they are all barbarians in Romans eyes. Germanic tribes might have merged Celtic tribes when they move from herders to farmers when they can no longer expand their territory due to the Romans.

Celtics (Greek) and Gauls (Roman) mostly refers to the same people. Romans definition may be limited to those living in France.

the Gauls crossed the Apes and sacked the early Rome in northern Italy around 391B.C. Celts has since been treated by the Romans as barbarians and threats in the north.
Around 200B.C., Western Europe was divided into 3 territories: Germanic tribes in the far North, Romans and Greeks in the Mediterranean and Celtics occupying the middle.
in 120B.C, the Germanic tribes Jutes lead by the Teutons and Kenbre in Denmark moved southeast because of a flood. They defeated the Romans and settled near Rome, bringing fearful memory to the Romans. Around the same time, Celtic territory was infringed by the Germanic tribes from the north and the Romans formed their standing armies. Seeing the stressed Celtics, the Romans, lead by Julius Caesar in 59-55B.C, conquered the Gauls in the name of "stabilizing the region". But he was defeated by British Celts in 55B.C. the Celts unified and revolted in 55B.C., aborting Caesar's second expedition to Britain.
Witnessing Caesar's victory, his political opponent Pompeii persuaded the senate to order Caesar to disband his army and return to Rome. Caesar refused to obey and Pompeii alleged him of treason. Caesar, suspecting he will probably be executed if he entered Rome as a civilian, took his army across the Rubicon River in 49B.C. Caesar then win the political struggle and became the first dictator of Roman, marking the beginning of the Roman Empire.
The Romans assimilated the Gauls and Latin evolved into French in the region. With the Norman invasion in 1066 brought many Latin words into English through this vein of lineage.
Celtic language in the European continent had mostly died out after the invasion from the Germanic tribes and Romans. The culture barely survived to these days in British Isles and northern France.

After this defeat of Gauls, Germano-Celtic living in the west were still nomadic herders and hard to conquer. In 4AD, the Romans controlled the Province of Germania in the east of Rhine.

[Roman Empire: Battle of the Teutoburg Forest](http://militaryhistory.about.com/od/battleswarsto1000/p/Roman-Empire-Battle-Of-The-Teutoburg-Forest.htm)
Varus, a highly respected Roman General, was ambushed with 3 legions by revolting Germanic troops lead by his advisory Arminius, son of a German chieftain.
this stopped the Romans expansion further. Rhine became the de facto boundary between the Roman empire and Germania.

Arian, German culture

the early Germanic tribes are documented in details in 'Germania' by Tacitus, a Roman scholar, in the late 100A.D. Germania was lost in the dark ages but was rediscovered in 1453 in a German abby. on one hand the Germania brought valuable information about the early history of Germanic tribes, on the other it praised the Germans unrealistically in order to criticize the corruption of the contemporary Romans.
In 100 A.D., the Germanic tribes coalesce into larger and more distinct tribal units. Goths E, Angles, Saxons, Franks W, vanguard emerges from these tribes and formed their own culture and language.

German legend and mythology 24

Runic writing became common amongst the Germans around 600 A.D.

the visigoths entered the western roman. empire to evade the Huns at 380. yet the Romans were not able to support the vast majority of people, many of the visigoths were sold as slave in return for food. this lead to a rebel against the Romans in the Balkan peninsula. the visigoths, with stirrup learnt from the Huns, defeated the Romans and occupied the region. the visigoths then moved to Italy in 402, the Romans have to retreat from her Rhine to protect Rome, the lead to the invasion of Rome on all fronts. the visigoths sacked Rome in 410.

around the same time, the British Romans were attacked by the Celtic Picks from the North and the Saxons from the sea. But the Romans were busy fighting the Goths on Europa and not responding to their call for support. this effectively ended Roman's control on the British isles. in 450 the Anglo Saxon invasion of Britain accelerated and evolved from raids to colonization.

410-600 is called the Lost Century of British History because there was no written record from the illiterate Anglo-Saxons after the Romans abandoned Britain.
