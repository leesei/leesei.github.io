## I need no magic

[Magic (programming) - Wikiwand](<https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Magic_(programming)>)
[Where do you stand on "magic" within languages and frameworks? - DEV Community](https://dev.to/ben/where-do-you-stand-on-magic-within-languages-and-frameworks-1071)
[Node.js is a Salad Bar ‚Äî Medium](https://medium.com/@modernserf/node-js-is-a-salad-bar-74ec01bd4390#.6gi4zr9a4)

> Magic is good when it's documented and you're given the ability to inspect the magical bits to find the science behind them.
> Magic is bad when there are many layers of indirection/metaprogramming, nothing about how it works is documented, and there's no obvious way of overriding their magic with your own magic.
>
> The way I use the term "magic" is whenever there's implicit behavior (generally based on naming rules, but sometimes on introspection/reflection, scanning, etc.) that generally cause "action at a distance"; it can probably be generalized as "too much abstractions, more than you can comprehend".
