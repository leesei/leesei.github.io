Factoring problem, the discrete logarithm problem, and the period-finding problem, can be solved efficiently (in polynomial time) with general-purpose quantum computer, known as a Cryptographically Relevant Quantum Computer (CRQC).
This makes asymmetric cryptographic algorithms like RSA, ECC, DH vulnerable to CRQC's attack.
