### Cloudflare

[How to Get a FREE SSL Certificate with Hostinger - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsELqvQfAyM)

- create Cloudflare account
- point to a domain with records
- enable Let's Encrypt

CloudFlare Protection on Hostinger
For 1 CloudFlare Protection plan, you can only use it for 1 website/domain and all its subdomains as long as the domain/website is pointed to us.
We use Cloudflare’s free plan here at Hostinger. It does provide you with these features:

- DDoS attack mitigation
- Global Content Delivery Network (CDN)

The main differences between using Cloudflare with Hostinger directly with and Cloudflare.com are:

- DNS zone can be fully managed from Hostinger side – so you don’t need to worry about updating DNS Records in different places: all of your domain’s DNS management will be in one place
- All main setting of Cloudflare can be found in hPanel – so changing security level will only take a few clicks
- One time activation fee – and Cloudflare will secure your domain and all of your subdomains as long as your domain is hosted with us 💜
