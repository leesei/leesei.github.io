> I'm using Atomic state manager instead of Redux
> use old materials for the concepts rather than the syntax

Redux by Dan Abramov (gaearon) implements Flux Store in a FP way. This enables a lot of interesting tools, including _time travel_ with app state. He committed the topic to a conference and Redux came out of the demo code. It is now part of the official React project.

The official, opinionated, batteries-included toolset for efficient Redux development.
It also removed most of the need for Redux middlewares (`redux-thunk`, `redux-saga`, ...).

## Action and ActionCreator

```js
// Action
{ type: 'ADD_TODO', payload: 'Use Redux' }

// ActionCreator
addTodo = (text) => {
  return { type: 'ADD_TODO', payload: text };
}

// thunk, return function/promise for `dispatch()`
// avoid accessing state other than conditional dispatch
// (using cached data, checking authentication)
// passing data in store is considered an anti-pattern
// OR perform any side effect (fat action)
export function addTodoWithCheck(text) {
  return (dispatch, getState) => {
    if (getState().todos.length === 3) {
      // early exit
      return;
    }

    dispatch(addTodo(text));
  }
}
```

## Reducer

```js
reducer = (state, action) => {
  return newState;
};

// reducing boilerplate with `createReducer()` and state slicing
function createReducer(initialState, handlers) {
  return function reducer(state = initialState, action) {
    if (handlers.hasOwnProperty(action.type)) {
      return handlers[action.type](state, action);
    } else {
      return state;
    }
  };
}

const visibilityReducer = createReducer("SHOW_ALL", {
  SET_VISIBILITY_FILTER: (visibilityState, action) => action.visibility,
});

const todosReducer = createReducer([], {
  // case handlers
  ADD_TODO: addTodo,
  TOGGLE_TODO: toggleTodo,
  EDIT_TODO: editTodo,
});

const appReducer = combineReducers({
  visibilityFilter: visibilityReducer,
  todos: todosReducer,
});
```

### Middleware

Redux middleware is designed by creating functions that can be composed together before the main dispatch method is invoked.

[Understanding Redux Middleware - Mark - Medium](https://medium.com/@meagle/understanding-87566abcfb7a)
[Methods for tracking action status in Redux - LogRocket Blog](https://blog.logrocket.com/tracking-action-status-in-redux/) `type.endsWith("_REQUEST|SUCCESS|FAILURE")` to set state

```js
(storeInstance) =>
  (functionToCallWithAnActionThatWillSendItToTheNextMiddleware) =>
  (actionThatDispatchWasCalledWith) =>
    valueToUseAsTheReturnValueOfTheDispatchCall;
// or in short
(store) => (next) => (action) => result;

// redux-thunk
const middledWare =
  ({ dispatch, getState }) =>
  (next) =>
  (action) => {
    if (typeof action === "function") {
      return action(dispatch, getState, extraArgument);
    }
    return next(action);
  };
```

```js
const middlewares = applyMiddleware(middleware1, middleware2);
const store = createStore(reducers, initialState, middlewares);
```

```js
export function loadPosts(userId) {
  return {
    // Types of actions to emit before and after
    types: ["LOAD_POSTS_REQUEST", "LOAD_POSTS_SUCCESS", "LOAD_POSTS_FAILURE"],
    // Check the cache (optional):
    shouldCallAPI: (state) => !state.posts[userId],
    // Perform the fetching:
    callAPI: () => fetch(`http://myapi.com/users/${userId}/posts`),
    // Arguments to inject in begin/end actions
    payload: { userId },
  };
}

function callAPIMiddleware({ dispatch, getState }) {
  return (next) => (action) => {
    const {
      types,
      callAPI,
      shouldCallAPI = (state) => true,
      payload = {},
    } = action;

    if (!types) {
      // Normal action: pass it on
      return next(action);
    }

    if (!shouldCallAPI(getState())) {
      return;
    }

    const [requestType, successType, failureType] = types;

    dispatch(
      Object.assign({}, payload, {
        type: requestType,
      })
    );

    return callAPI().then(
      (response) =>
        dispatch(
          Object.assign({}, payload, {
            response,
            type: successType,
          })
        ),
      (error) =>
        dispatch(
          Object.assign({}, payload, {
            error,
            type: failureType,
          })
        )
    );
  };
}
```

## Store

```js
import { combineReducers, createStore, applyMiddleware } from "redux";

rootReducer = combineReducers({ key1: reducer1, key2: reducer2 });
store = createStore(rootReducer, initState, applyMiddleware(middlewares));
```

### Enhancers

Enhancers return a new **enhanced** version of `createStore()`. `applyMiddleware()` is (actually it returns) an enhancer.

```js
const ourAwesomeEnhancer =
  (createStore) => (reducer, initialState, enhancer) => {
    const store = createStore(monitoredReducer, initialState, enhancer);
    //  add enhancer logic

    return {
      ...store,
      //   you can override the some store properties or add new ones
    };
  };
```
