## Fission Bomb/Atomic Bomb

Shaped C4 (insensitive) charges are used send shockwave to compress the core from different direction uniformly. When the core reaches criticality, it will start the nuclear chain reaction.

Core X (Thin Man, Implosion type, Trinity test in New Mexico, July 16, 1945)
Core #0 (Little Boy, Gun type, Hiroshima, August 6, 1945)
Core #1 (Big Boy, Implosion type, Trinity Nuclear Test)
Core #2 (Fat Man, Gun type, Nagasaki, August 9, 1945)
Core #3 (Rufus, Demon Core)

Gun type bomb: Uranium ores contains small portion of fissionable U-235 so enrichment by centrifuge has to be done. Two separate slugs of U-235, each under the critical mass, are smashed together with a gun-like contraption. The yield (efficiency) of this kind of bomb is low.

Implosion type bomb:　 Plutonium has smaller critical mass than U-235 and cost less to produce then Uranium enrichment. The Plutonium Core is molded to a spherical shell. Beryllium and Polonium inside the shell serves as a neutron source (the Urchin). Explosives surrounding the shell will set off and compress the shell to make it more difficult for the neutrons to escape.

## Hydrogen Bomb/Fusion Bomb/Thermonuclear Bomb

An Implosion type Fission bomb is used to create the temperature and pressure to kick start nuclear fusion
