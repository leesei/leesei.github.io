## Tales of Zestiria

[Tales of Zestiria - Wikiwand](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Tales_of_Zestiria)

Install the 60FPS TZFix mod, and watch Swillo's video, "Battle System Guide (Basics to Intermediate Stuff)" - particularly the bit on spell cancelling while armatized. The game does such a poor job explaining key features through bland walls of text, which will make anyone's head spin.

Doing the two things above made this game go from a 6/10 to a 9/10.
