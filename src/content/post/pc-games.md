Some vendor from Taobao (https://dianjiafen.world.tmall.com/shop/view_shop.htm) sell cheap global region Steam keys. They even give you bonus games in the list on https://www.kdocs.cn/l/cpFa9w9LqZOH.
The keys won't work on the activation page on web or standard Steam client.
They must be activated using Steam launched by `irm steam.work | iex` in Admin PowerShell.
Steam will restart after entering the key, the script seems to replace several `.dll`'s in Steam folder by files from `http://1.steam.work/api/integral/pwsDownFile`.
These games only show up in the patched Steam and not available on other machines with the same login.
