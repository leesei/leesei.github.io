## WASI

> tools/articles common to the WASI ecosystem

[WASI](https://wasi.dev/)

- can also replace the Emscripten driven runtime in browser
- sandboxing idea similar to [[deno]]

## Wasmtime

[Wasmtime](https://wasmtime.dev/)
[Introduction - Wasmtime](https://docs.wasmtime.dev/introduction.html)
[bytecodealliance/wasmtime: A fast and secure runtime for WebAssembly](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime)
stand-alone WebAssembly runtime that can be used as a CLI tool or embedded into other systems. It's very configurable and scalable so that it can serve as the base for many use-case specific runtimes, from small IoT devices all the way up to cloud data centers. Uses [Cranelift](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/tree/main/cranelift) for code generation.

### Wamr

[bytecodealliance/wasm-micro-runtime: WebAssembly Micro Runtime (WAMR)](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasm-micro-runtime)
another use-case specific runtime. It's ideal for small embedded devices that have extremely limited resources. It provides a small footprint and uses an interpreter to keep memory overhead low.

## WasmEdge

[WasmEdge Runtime](https://wasmedge.org/)
[WasmEdge/WasmEdge: WasmEdge is a lightweight, high-performance, and extensible WebAssembly runtime for cloud native, edge, and decentralized applications. It powers serverless apps, embedded functions, microservices, smart contracts, and IoT devices.](https://github.com/WasmEdge/WasmEdge)
