## PKI

The **authentication** of server relied on Certificate Authorities (CA) and a public key infrastructure using [X.509](http://www.wikiwand.com/en/X.509) certificates.
The server register with a CA who sign the server's public key with the key of CA for a fee. The client, after receiving the public key from server, verifies server's signature of session randoms and the certificate chain.

### Trusted CA

Linux's trusted CA certs are store in `/etc/ssl/certs/`:

```sh
fd . '/etc/ssl/certs/' -e pem | xargs -d"\n" -n1 -I@ -P(nproc) openssl x509 -in @ -text -noout
```

### Rouge CA

As it turns out, CA may not be trust-worthy after all. There are many instances of CA issuing fraudulent certificates (willingly or being hacked).

## TLS Cert

1. go to [Google](https://google.com/)
2. view cert info
3. export/download cert

```sh
# view cert info
openssl x509 -inform PEM -in certificate.pem -noout -text

# dump key
openssl x509 -inform PEM -in certificate.pem -pubkey -noout > public_key.pem

# For RSA keys
openssl rsa -inform PEM -pubin -in public_key.pem -modulus -noout

# For ECDSA keys
openssl ec -inform PEM -pubin -in public_key.pem -pubout -text

# For Ed25519 keys
openssl pkey -inform PEM -pubin -in public_key.pem -pubout -text
```

key: no meta data, just the prime numbers and modulus
cert: with meta data

X.509 is the PKI protocol and defines the actual certificate (container) format
DER, PEM, PKCS#7, PKCS#8, PKCS#12 are encoding standards

PEM (Privacy Enhanced Mail) base64 DER, with text headers and footers
File extensions: `.pem`, `.key`, `.csr`, `.crt`
DER (Distinguished Encoding Rules), binary without text headers and footers
File extensions: `.der`, `.cer`
PKCS (Public-Key Cryptography Standards)
File extensions: `.p7b` (PKCS#7/CMS), `.pfx`, `.p12` (PKCS#12 binary), `.csr` (PKCS#10 base64), `.req` (PKCS#10)

```sh
# view cert
openssl x509 -in cert.pem -text -noout

# match public and private key
openssl x509 -in cert.pem -noout -modulus
openssl rsa -in privkey.pem -noout -modulus
# regenerate public key
openssl rsa -in privkey.pem -pubout
```
