[The Biggest Myth In Education - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhgwIhB58PA)

**Visual learner**
If you are a visual learner, you love visualizing ideas and concepts. You can create mind maps of the concepts.

**Auditory learner**
If you are an auditory learner, then you are likely to learn by listening to someone talk about the subject.

**Reading/writing learner**
If you are a reading/writing learner, then you are likely to learn from reading programming books and taking notes.

**Kinesthetic learner**
If you are a Kinesthetic learner, then you learn best by doing. You like to engage in learning that involves physically acting out what you have learned.
