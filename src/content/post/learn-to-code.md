Don't learn one framework, instead learn the concepts and patterns behind all of them ‚Äì and the differences that can help you choose the right tool for the job.

No framework or library is a silver bullet. But the right choice can save you a lot of hassle.

### Concurrency and Parallelism

[[go-lang#Concurrency]]
[[python-notes#Concurrency]]
[[rust#Async/Future]]

Concurrency:

- composition of independently executing processes
- multiple tasks
- about _dealing_ with lots of things at once, about structure

Parallelism:

- simultaneous execution of computations
- multiple processing units
- about _doing_ lots of things at once, about execution
- Concurrency is a prerequisite

[Node.js is a Salad Bar ‚Äî Medium](https://medium.com/@modernserf/node-js-is-a-salad-bar-74ec01bd4390#.6gi4zr9a4)

> Magic is good when it's documented and you're given the ability to inspect the magical bits to find the science behind them.
> Magic is bad when there are many layers of indirection/metaprogramming, nothing about how it works is documented, and there's no obvious way of overriding their magic with your own magic.
>
> The way I use the term "magic" is whenever there's implicit behavior (generally based on naming rules, but sometimes on introspection/reflection, scanning, etc.) that generally cause "action at a distance"; it can probably be generalized as "too much abstractions, more than you can comprehend".

## Software Development Process

- User requirement  
  meeting with customer (by sales and presales engineer)  
  determine requirements, scope of work and development, delivery flow
- UI mock up, storyboard, proof of concepts
- setup milestones  
  usually the project will be too big to implement in one shot  
  divide it into milestones and gather feedback on each  
  usually we use features to divide milestone  
  also take note of the the delivery date of each milestone (see next)
- task list and schedule  
  divide feature into tasks  
  assign developers to each task  
  estimate resources (man-day) for each task  
  resources should be fully utilized  
  reserve time before delivery date for integration and QA
- sign contract  
  the above planning should be included
- intermittent releases (release candidates)  
  these are sub-milestones within the development team  
  QA can test on RC for completed features and bug fixes
- requirements update is done via feature change request

| Context           | A high-level diagram that sets the scene; including key system dependencies and people (actors/roles/personas/etc). Context diagrams are standard in software engineering (even if not used often). |
| Container         | A container diagram shows the high-level technology choices, how responsibilities are distributed across them and how the containers communicate.                                                   |
| Component         | For each container, a component diagram lets you see the key logical components and their relationships.                                                                                            |
| Classes (or Code) | This is optional and is the lowest level of detail.                                                                                                                                                 |

## Signal Processing

[Circles Sines and Signals - Introduction](http://jackschaedler.github.io/circles-sines-signals/)

## Level of Abstraction

We are seeing a trend that a high level language (the source code input by a programmer) is transpiled to a core set of features/primitives (e.g. MIR of Rust, asm.js of JavaScript), then the intermediate representation is further compiled by LLVM, which then compiles to the machine code of specific architecture to make the code portable.

Language specific optimization can be added when parsing the source code to intermediate representation. It also helps simplify the code for LLVM and can hint LLVM to make more optimized code.
