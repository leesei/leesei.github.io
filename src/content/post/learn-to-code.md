- "Short cuts makes long delays." - Pippin
- It's preferable to learn a breath of languages, rather than depth in only one language.
- Tutorials aren't for learning, they demonstrates how something is done.
- Becoming a software engineer is NOT a "get-rich-quick" scheme. It's a "get-upper-middle-class-slow" scheme.

No framework or library is a silver bullet. But the right choice can save you a lot of hassle.

## Software Development Process

- User requirement
  meeting with customer (by sales and presales engineer)
  determine requirements, scope of work and development, delivery flow
- UI mock up, storyboard, proof of concepts
- setup milestones
  usually the project will be too big to implement in one shot
  divide it into milestones and gather feedback on each
  usually we use features to divide milestone
  also take note of the the delivery date of each milestone (see next)
- task list and schedule
  divide feature into tasks
  assign developers to each task
  estimate resources (man-day) for each task
  resources should be fully utilized
  reserve time before delivery date for integration and QA
- sign contract
  the above planning should be included
- intermittent releases (release candidates)
  these are sub-milestones within the development team
  QA can test on RC for completed features and bug fixes
- requirements update is done via feature change request

## Signal Processing

[Circles Sines and Signals - Introduction](http://jackschaedler.github.io/circles-sines-signals/)

## Level of Abstraction

We are seeing a trend that a high level language (the source code input by a programmer) is transpiled to a core set of features/primitives (e.g. MIR of Rust, asm.js of JavaScript), then the intermediate representation is further compiled by LLVM, which then compiles to the machine code of specific architecture to make the code portable.

Language specific optimization can be added when parsing the source code to intermediate representation. It also helps simplify the code for LLVM and can hint LLVM to make more optimized code.
